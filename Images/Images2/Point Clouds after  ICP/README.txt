These images depict the visualizations of the results of the ICP algorithm to register two point clouds. The chair example was run for 35 iterations and a fitness score of 0.16 was obtained. The monitor example was run for 55 iterations and a fitness score of 0.15 was obtained. The human example was run for 300 iterations and the algorithm gave a false positive saying it converged because of a small number of correspondences that matched the criteria.
