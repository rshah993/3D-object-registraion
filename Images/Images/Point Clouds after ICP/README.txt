These images depict the visualizations of the results of the ICP algorithm to register two point clouds. The chair example was run for 26 iterations and a fitness score of 0.0045 was obtained. The monitor example was run for 35 iterations and a fitness score of 0.0077 was obtained. The short term goals are to test with more objects, test with multiple objects in the frame and test with continuous registration of point clouds in real time.
